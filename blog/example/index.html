            <h2 class="h3" id="hawthorn-berries-crataegus oxyacantha-1">Hawthorn Berries (Crataegus oxyacantha)</h2>
            <p class="lead">Hawthorn berries are tiny fruits that grow on trees and shrubs belonging to the <em>Crataegus</em> genus.</p>
            <p class="lead">The genus includes hundreds of species commonly found in Europe, North America, and Asia.</p>
            <p class="lead">Their berries are packed with nutrition and have a tart, tangy taste and mild sweetness, ranging in color from yellow to deep red to black (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26378574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>).</p>
            <p class="lead">For centuries, hawthorn berry has been used as an herbal remedy for digestive problems, heart failure, and high blood pressure. In fact, itâ€™s a key part of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
            <p class="lead">Here are 9 impressive health benefits of hawthorn berry.</p>

            <h2 class="h3" id="loaded-with-antioxidants-2">1. Loaded with antioxidants</h2>
            <p>Hawthorn berry is a rich source of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/polyphenols">polyphenols</a>, which are powerful antioxidant compounds found in plants (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>).</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained">Antioxidants</a> help neutralize unstable molecules called free radicals that can harm your body when they are present at high levels. These molecules can come from poor diet, as well as environmental toxins like air pollution and cigarette smoke (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29952268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>).</p>
            <p>Due to their antioxidant activity, polyphenols have been associated with numerous health benefits, including a lower risk of the following (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20716914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28284186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5</a>):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>some cancers</li>
              <li>type 2 diabetes</li>
              <li>asthma</li>
              <li>some infections</li>
              <li>heart problems</li>
              <li>premature skin aging</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Though initial research is promising, more studies are needed to assess hawthorn berriesâ€™ effects on disease risk.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> Hawthorn berry contains plant polyphenols that have been linked to numerous health benefits due to their antioxidant properties.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="may-have-anti-inflammatory-properties-3">2. May have anti-inflammatory properties</h2>
            <p>Hawthorn berry may have anti-inflammatory properties that could improve your health.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/chronic-inflammation">Chronic inflammation</a> has been linked to many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, asthma, and certain cancers (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23044824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8</a>).</p>
            <p>In a study in mice with liver disease, hawthorn berry extract significantly reduced levels of inflammatory compounds (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27531227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9</a>).</p>
            <p>Whatâ€™s more, research in mice with asthma showed that supplementing with hawthorn berry extract decreased inflammation enough to significantly reduce asthma symptoms (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23029210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10</a>).</p>
            <p>Due to these promising results from animal and test-tube studies, scientists believe the supplement may offer anti-inflammatory benefits in humans. However, more research is needed.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> In test-tube and animal studies, hawthorn berry extract has shown anti-inflammatory potential. Still, more research in humans is needed.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="may-lower-blood-pressure-4">3. May lower blood pressure</h2>
            <p>In traditional Chinese medicine, hawthorn berry is one of the most commonly recommended foods to help <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/lower-it-fast">treat high blood pressure</a> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27852126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11</a>).</p>
            <p>Several animal studies show that hawthorn can act as a vasodilator, meaning it can relax constricted <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-that-increase-blood-flow">blood vessels</a>, ultimately lowering blood pressure (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9839542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10901280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16779533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23685938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15</a>).</p>
            <p>In a 10-week study in 36 people with mildly elevated blood pressure, those taking 500 mg of hawthorn extract daily experienced no significant decreases in blood pressure, although they showed a trend toward reduced diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number of a reading) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">16</a>).</p>
            <p>Another 16-week study in 79 people with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure observed that those who took 1,200 mg of hawthorn extract daily had greater improvements in blood pressure, compared with those in the placebo group (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16762125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17</a>).</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, a similar study in 21 people with mildly elevated blood pressure noted no differences between the hawthorn-extract and placebo groups (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22458601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18</a>).</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> Some evidence suggests that hawthorn berry may reduce blood pressure by helping dilate blood vessels. However, not all studies agree.</blockquote>

            <p><img src="/crazy-nutrition-dev/img/blog/img-hawthorn-tree.jpg" alt="A hawthorn tree."></p>

            <h2 class="h3" id="may-decrease-blood-fats-5">4. May decrease blood fats</h2>
            <p>Some studies indicate that hawthorn extract may improve blood fat levels.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-cholesterol-diet">Cholesterol</a> and triglycerides are two types of fats always present in your blood. </p>
            <p>At normal levels, theyâ€™re perfectly healthy and play very important roles in hormone production and nutrient transport throughout your body.</p>
            <p>However, imbalanced blood fat levels, particularly high triglycerides and low HDL (good) cholesterol, play a role in atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup in your blood vessels (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19</a>). </p>
            <p>If plaque continues to accumulate, it could completely block a blood vessel, leading to heart attack or stroke.</p>
            <p>In one study, mice given two different doses of hawthorn extract had lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, as well as 28â€“47% lower liver triglyceride levels, compared with mice that did not receive the extract (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27187458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20</a>).</p>
            <p>Similarly, in a study in mice on a high-cholesterol diet, both hawthorn extract and the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin reduced total cholesterol and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-ways-to-lower-triglycerides">triglycerides</a> about equally, but the extract also decreased LDL (bad) cholesterol (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19885950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21</a>).</p>
            <p>Though this research is promising, more human studies are needed to assess the effect of hawthorn extract on blood fats. </p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> Hawthorn extract has been shown to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels in animal studies. More research is needed to determine whether it has similar effects in humans.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="used-to-aid-digestion-6">5. Used to aid digestion</h2>
            <p>Hawthorn berries and hawthorn extract have been used for centuries to treat digestive issues, particularly indigestion and stomach pain. </p>
            <p>The berries contain <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-is-fiber-good-for-you">fiber</a>, which has been proven to aid digestion by reducing constipation and acting as a prebiotic.</p>
            <p>Prebiotics feed your healthy <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/improve-gut-bacteria">gut bacteria</a> and are vital to maintaining healthy digestion (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25659062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22</a>). </p>
            <p>One observational study in people with slow digestion found that each additional gram of dietary fiber consumed decreased the time between bowel movements by approximately 30 minutes (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26950143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23</a>).</p>
            <p>Additionally, a rat study observed that hawthorn extract dramatically reduced the transit time of food in the digestive system (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29291866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24</a>). </p>
            <p>This means that food moves more quickly through your digestive system, which may alleviate indigestion.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in a study in rats with stomach ulcers, hawthorn extract exhibited the same protective effect on the stomach as an anti-ulcer medication (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18698794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a>).</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> Hawthorn berry has been used as a digestive aid for centuries. It can decrease the transit time of food in your digestive system. Whatâ€™s more, its fiber content is a prebiotic and may help relieve constipation.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="helps-prevent-hair-loss-7">6. Helps prevent hair loss</h2>
            <p>Hawthorn berry may even prevent hair loss and is a common ingredient in commercial <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-for-hair-growth">hair growth</a> products.</p>
            <p>One study in rats found that mountain hawthorn extract stimulated hair growth and increased the number and size of hair follicles, promoting healthier hair (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">25</a>).</p>
            <p>Itâ€™s believed that the polyphenol content in hawthorn berry causes this beneficial effect. Nevertheless, research in this area is limited, and human studies are needed.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> Hawthorn berry is an ingredient in some hair growth products. Its polyphenol content may promote healthy hair growth, but more research is needed.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="may-reduce-anxiety-8">7. May reduce anxiety</h2>
            <p>Hawthorn has a very mild sedative effect, which may help decrease anxiety symptoms (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9107558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">26</a>).</p>
            <p>In a study on hawthornâ€™s effect on blood pressure, while people taking hawthorn extract didnâ€™t report significantly lower levels of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/16-ways-relieve-stress-anxiety">anxiety</a>, there was a trend towards reduced anxiety (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">16</a>).</p>
            <p>In another study in 264 people with anxiety, a combination of hawthorn, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-magnesium-benefits">magnesium</a>, and California poppy flower significantly reduced anxiety levels, compared to a placebo. Still, itâ€™s unclear what role hawthorn played, specifically (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14741074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">27</a>).</p>
            <p>Given that it has few side effects compared to traditional anti-anxiety medications, hawthorn continues to be researched as a potential treatment for disorders of the central nervous system, such as anxiety and depression (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26378574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>).</p>
            <p>However, more research is needed. If you want to try a hawthorn supplement to manage your anxiety, donâ€™t discontinue any of your current medications and be sure to discuss it with your healthcare provider.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> No strong evidence indicates that hawthorn supplements may reduce anxiety. More research is needed before recommendations can be made.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="used-to-treat-heart-failure-9">8. Used to treat heart failure</h2>
            <p>Hawthorn berry is best known for its use alongside traditional medications in the treatment of heart failure. </p>
            <p>A review of 14 randomized studies in more than 850 people concluded that those who took hawthorn extract along with their heart failure medications experienced improved heart function and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise">exercise</a> tolerance. </p>
            <p>They also experienced less shortness of breath and fatigue (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18254076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">28</a>).</p>
            <p>Whatâ€™s more, a 2-year observational study in 952 people with heart failure found that those supplementing with hawthorn berry extract had less <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-you-are-tired">fatigue</a>, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations than people who did not supplement with it.</p>
            <p>The group taking hawthorn berry also required fewer medications to manage their heart failure (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15353901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">29</a>).</p>
            <p>Finally, another large study in over 2,600 people with heart failure suggested that supplementing with hawthorn berry may reduce the risk of sudden heart-related death (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19019730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30</a>).</p>
            <p>People with heart failure are often encouraged to take hawthorn berry in addition to their current medications, as the supplement is considered safe with few side effects (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18254076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">28</a>).</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> Hawthorn berry is beneficial for people with heart failure, as it has been shown to improve heart function and decrease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="easy-to-add-to-your-diet-10">9. Easy to add to your diet</h2>
            <p>Hawthorn berry may be difficult to find at your local grocery store. However, you should be able to find it at farmersâ€™ markets, specialty health food stores, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Z6GpCb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">online</a>.</p>
            <p>You can add hawthorn to your diet in many ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Raw.</strong> Raw hawthorn berries have a tart, slightly sweet taste and make a great <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-food-choices-on-the-go">on-the-go snack</a>.</li>
              <li><strong>Tea.</strong> You can buy premade hawthorn tea or make your own using the dried berries, flowers, and leaves of the plant.</li>
              <li><strong>Jams and desserts.</strong> In the Southeastern United States, hawthorn berries are commonly made into jam, pie filling, and syrup.</li>
              <li><strong>Wine and vinegar.</strong> Hawthorn berries can be fermented into a tasty adult beverage or a flavorful vinegar that can be used to make salad dressing.</li>
              <li><strong>Supplements.</strong> You can take hawthorn berry supplements in a convenient powder, pill, or liquid form.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Hawthorn berry supplements usually contain the berry along with the leaves and flowers. Although, some include only the leaves and flowers, as theyâ€™re a more concentrated source of antioxidants than the berry itself. </p>
            <p>Different brands and forms of hawthorn supplements have varying dosage recommendations.</p>
            <p>According to one report, the minimum effective dose of hawthorn extract for heart failure is 300 mg daily (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15992662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31</a>).</p>
            <p>Typical doses are 250â€“500 mg, taken three times daily.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other governing body. </p>
            <p>Therefore, itâ€™s nearly impossible to know the true effectiveness or safety of a supplement. Always purchase them from reputable sources.</p>
            <p>Look for products that have received a seal of approval from independent organizations that assess supplement effectiveness and quality, such as United States Pharmacopeia (USP), NSF International, or ConsumerLab.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> Hawthorn berries can be eaten in many ways or taken as a supplement. Supplements are not regulated, so itâ€™s important to buy them from sources you trust.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="side-effects-and-precautions-11">Side effects and precautions</h2>
            <p>Very few side effects have been reported from taking hawthorn berry. </p>
            <p>However, some people have complained of mild <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-to-eat-when-nauseous">nausea</a> or dizziness (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18254076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">28</a>).</p>
            <p>Due to its potent effect on the heart, it can affect certain medications. If youâ€™re taking drugs for your heart, blood pressure, or cholesterol, speak with your healthcare provider before using hawthorn berry supplements.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Summary</strong> Hawthorn berry is safe with few side effects. Speak with your healthcare professional before starting this supplement if youâ€™re on any heart medications.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="h3" id="the-bottom-line-12">The bottom line</h2>
            <p>Primarily due to its antioxidant content, hawthorn berry has numerous health effects, especially for your heart. </p>
            <p>Studies indicate that it may improve blood pressure and blood fat levels, as well as treat heart failure when combined with standard medications.</p>
            <p>In addition, it may reduce inflammation, promote hair growth, and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ways-to-improve-digestion">aid digestion</a>.</p>
